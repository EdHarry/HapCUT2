## Subdirectory for Hi-C (Proximity Ligation) data analysis, issues and pipelines 

For improved haplotype accuracy with Hi-C reads, use the --HiC 1 option for both extractHAIRS and HapCUT2 steps.

HapCUT2 implements an EM-like procedure to estimate the trans-error rates for Hi-C data. The default value of the maximum insert size is 40 megabases.
