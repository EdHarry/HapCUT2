REQUIREMENTS
=============

HapCUT2 is written in C and requires a gcc like compiler to compile the source code. HapCUT2 requires the htslib library (> 1.2.1) for reading BAM files. It is assumed that htslib is installed, but otherwise the path can be specified in the Makefile (HTSLIB=path). To install htslib directly from source:

git clone https://github.com/samtools/htslib.git
cd htslib
make


HOW TO COMPILE THE CODE
========================

Run 'make' in the project master directory.


HOW TO INSTALL THE PROGRAMS
========================

Run 'sudo make install' after compiling the code.
